## Objectives of this talk

- Best practices for package design
- Building an R package
- Distribution of your package

## Best practices for package design

30-35 minutes worth of content

 Implementing sound design principles
-baby package
-real one - real design doc to 

## Building an R package 


## Why Distribute Your Package?

From David Robinson's excellent talk at rstudio::conf(2019)

```{r dr, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/dr.jpeg")
```

## Why Distribute Your Package?

- Gains in usership/citations for those in the public domain (academics, nonprofits)
- Gains in productivity for those in private industries
- Saving future you time

## Using Version Control

```{r organized, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/ann.jpeg")
```

- This is not a Git talk, but Git has become a dominant version control technique so we are demo-ing our work on Github
- An amazing and free resource for R users is Jenny Brian's book: https://happygitwithr.com/

How this is useful to audit
Production version control - put R in prod
Focus more on why to use - maybe RStudio easy integration with github

How this is useful to audit/third parties
Easy to track changes over time
Issue driven development (working with teams) https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues
Production version control - put R in prod reference to talk

LD will start creating baby package using the usethis and testthat package
-function and 2 derivatives
-finite differences test to check derivatives - check for less than some kind of tolerance
