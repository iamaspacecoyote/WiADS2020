## About Us

 - Friends since meeting in our Statistics PhD program in 2011
 - Co-organizers of R Ladies-Twin Cities and the noRth conference
 - Both cyclists & coffee lovers
 
```{r ldck, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/ldck.jpg")
```

## Objectives of this talk

```{r setup, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(MyFirstPackage)

# Design your R package
design_package()

# Build your R package
build_package()

# Distribute of your R package
distribute_package()

#Profit!
```

## Best practices for R package design

```{r pam, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/pam.jpeg")
```

## What is a design document?

 - A blueprint or recipe for your project with plenty of details
 - Doc written with the understanding that future-you will forget these details otherwise


## Why use a design document? (1 of 5)
 - [Watch this video first!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NywzrUJnmTo)
 
## Why use a design document? (2 of 5)

 - Separates thinking and coding
 

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/twoseparate.jpg")
```

 Imagine creating enchiladas without a recipe!

## Why use a design document? (3 of 5)

 - Forces you to explain everything in detail 
 - Helps you predict problems and tricky points 

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/FoldItIn.jpg")
```
 
## Why use a design document? (4 of 5)

 - Helps you divide the work into reasonable modules so you can split it between days or people and make sure it it will come together seamlessly

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/LadleStir.jpg")
```
 
 No need to ladle and stir at the same time.

 
## Why use a design document? (5 of 5)
 
 - Helps future you/developers understand what you had done so that you can create improvements or additions
 - Helps you remember everything you'll inevitably forget
 
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/BurningSmellsLike.jpg")
```


 

## What to include in your design document
 - Goal of each function
 - Inputs and outputs of each
 - Flow chart between functions
 - Calculations/equations
 - Any tricky points
 - Numerical stability considerations 
 - How you will approach each function (and some pseudo code)
 - Tests you will implement (again goals, details)
 - Helpful sketches
 - Major updates
 - Things you want to add/change in the future

## Building an R package 

```{r lego1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/lego.jpeg")
```

## Create the Package

Building a package used to take a lot of expert knowledge. However, several R packages exist that now make the process extremely accessible.

```{r setup3, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install.packages('testthat', 'devtools', 
#                 'roxygen2', 'usethis')
library(testthat)
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
library(usethis)

usethis::create_package("~/MyFirstPackage")
# usethis::use_testthat() #if you want to add tests
usethis::use_git() #if you want to use Git

```

## Add your functions
```{r setup4, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}

usethis::use_r('target_psrf')
usethis::use_r('minESS')

```

## Write (or copy/paste) functions

```{r miness, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/partialfunc.jpeg")
```

## Add documentation for functions - Roxygen

```{r miness2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/fullfunc.jpeg")
```

## Add documentation for functions - Roxygen

```{r doc, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/doc.jpg")
```

## Check, build, and install your package

```{r check, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
devtools::check()
devtools::build()
devtools::install()
```

Or use the build tools in Rstudio
```{r build, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/buildtools.jpg")
```

## Customize!

- Add tests
- Add other package dependencies
- Add vignettes

```{r bedazzle, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/bedazzler.jpg")
```

## Distribution of Your R Package

```{r janet, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/janets.png")
```

## Why Distribute Your R Package?

From David Robinson's excellent talk at rstudio::conf(2019)

```{r dr, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/dr.jpeg")
```

## Why Distribute Your R Package?

- Gains in usership/citations for those in the public domain (academics, nonprofits)
- Gains in productivity for those in private industries
- Saving future you time

## Using Version Control

```{r organized, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/ann.jpg")
```

## Using Version Control

- This is not a Git talk, but Git has become a dominant version control technique so we are demo-ing our work on Github
- An amazing and free resource for R users is Jenny Brian's book: https://happygitwithr.com/

How this is useful to audit
Production version control - put R in prod
Focus more on why to use - maybe RStudio easy integration with github

How this is useful to audit/third parties
Easy to track changes over time
Issue driven development (working with teams) https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues
Production version control - put R in prod reference to talk
